<h1>The Best Movies According to Sanassy</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Salt</h3>

<p>It's gloriously absurd. This movie has holes in it big enough
     to drive the whole movie through. The laws of physics seem 
     to be suspended here the same way as in a Road Runner cartoon.
      Angelina Jolie runs full speed out into thin air and doesn't 
      look down until she's in the helicopterat the end.

<h3>Ambulance</h3>
<p>The conflict between career criminal Danny Sharp (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his adopted sibling, struggling veteran Will (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II). Bay’s world is one of good guys with principles and bad guys without, even when those principles cease to make any logical sense. But it’s not about making sense. It's about big, thunderous emotions. 
The ensuing heist goes horribly wrong, forcing the duo to hijack an ambulance as a combination getaway vehicle/camouflage so they can escape the police cruisers and SWAT vehicles and surveillance trucks surrounding the bank.</p>
<h3>1917</h3>
<p>I appreciate a long one-shot sequence that only exists for a filmmaker to show off his technical finesse, but if I had to make a list of the most effective one-shots, it would be the ones that are so absorbing for other reasons that we don't even realise at first that they've been done in what feels like one long take.</p>
